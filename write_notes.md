# About #

  * This extension uses the presentation notes to read text aloud, to interact with viewers and to create electronic books.
  * You can export the presentation as an HTML document, a .zip archive or an ePub book.
  * Click the **Notepad** button to write presentation notes or questions.
  * The extension produces unencrypted ePub 2.0 format eBooks that are optimized for reading text aloud. The text in the title and text fields of the presentation are saved as alternative text.

# Write Notes #

  * In the Impress editor, go to the first slide and click the Notepad button on the menu bar.
  * Type text. To enlarge the view, click the Appearance button. Click the Read the note button to read the text aloud. When you are done, click the OK button.
  * If you do not enter text in a note, the extension prompts you to enter some text when you audition the slideshow. If you want a blank slide note, enter a single space in the notes field.

# Audition a slideshow #

  * To read a slideshow, click the Read presentation button.
  * To display a presentation using alternate voices or web resources, click **Slide Show Tools** and select an option from the dialogue. Some toolbox options may require a good Internet connection. **Caution**. If you are using an online program or service, you may be responsible for connection or other charges. Some services send text in an unencrypted format. Third parties might be able to intercept the text. You affirm that you have read the terms of service for the online service provider and agree to abide by them. You understand that the terms of service may change from time to time, and it is your responsibility to ensure compliance. On-line services may be unavailable. Do not rely on them for essential services. Preview web resources before you use them in front of an audience.

# How to read an ePub document #

  * On the desktop, use [Readium](http://readium.org/) Extension for Chrome or Chromium or [ePub Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/) Extension for Firefox. Alternatively, you can open [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/books) or [MagicScroll](http://www.magicscroll.net/) in a system browser like Internet Explorer or Safari.
  * Apple iOS mobile devices can use [iBooks](http://www.apple.com/support/ios/ibooks/) to read ePub electronic books. On current versions of the Apple iOS, you can set up the system to read text aloud when you select some text. Use **Settings - General - Accessibility - Speak Selection**. Enable support for blind readers with [VoiceOver](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3598). Use **Settings - General - Accessibility - Triple Click Home - VoiceOver**. With VoiceOver turned on and pinch to zoom turned off, tap an image to hear the alternative text. To read text aloud continuously, tap the centre of the screen, then swipe down with two fingers. To pause the reading, tap with two fingers. To flip through a book, tap the centre of the screen, then swipe horizontally with three fingers.
  * The Android Play store includes several options for ePub books. [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/books) can show books that you have uploaded using your desktop browser. Google Play Books is also able to read most books aloud. The [FBReader](http://fbreader.org/) program can read ePub books aloud with an optional plug-in. The [Dolphin browser](http://dolphin-browser.com/) has an ePub plug-in that can display ePub books. Select some text, then export the selected text into the Talkadroid application to read it aloud. If you do not need speech synthesis, then [BlueFire Reader](http://www.bluefirereader.com/bluefire-reader.html) is a good general purpose eBook reader for Android.
  * Not all readers are available for all mobile devices. If a program does not appear in the download store, chances are that your device can’t use it.
  * You can transfer eBooks to devices by sending the eBooks via email, blog, or a “cloud” service.
  * The free [calibre-ebook](http://calibre-ebook.com/) program can modify metadata and convert ePub documents to other formats. For Kindle devices, use calibre-ebook to export an ePub publication to the mobi format.
