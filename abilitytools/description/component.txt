This extension makes it easy to export and publish presentations and electronic books. Use the Impress notes screen to add text to the presentation. The extension can read your notes aloud while you present. The extension can export your presentation as an ePub document, HTML, or as uncompressed Braille text. Applications like iBooks and Overdrive for iOS or Google Books and fbReader for Android can read your electronic documents aloud.
